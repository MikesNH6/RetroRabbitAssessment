# RetroRabbitAssessment

The solution can be run by downloading the file and opening the CodingChallenge.sln file. This should open in visual studio. 

Inside the project there will be a folder called Resources, this is where the text document is stored to make any changes. 

The solution can be run by looking in the projects and release folder and clicking on the executable, or can be run through visual studio.

The solution does a lot of validation on start up. Checks that everything is correct as per the requirements and also removes any special characters from text document. 

If there are any errors within the text document you will be prompted to make changes to the file. 

If you select no for any of the issues the program will terminate. 

If you select yes the program will terminate but will open up the text document which will allow you to edit it.

Once the text file is in the right format you will then be taken to the main search page. On the left hand side of the application you will be able to see the values inside the loaded text file.

On the right hand side of the application you will be able to search for equivalent strings and see the results for that search as you type. No need to submit anything because who needs waste time looking for buttons anymore.

I hope you enjoy my work as much as I did making it!
